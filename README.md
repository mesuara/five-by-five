#Five by Five to be continued....

Now that we know more about styling let’s go back to our five-by-five project and make it more appealing.

I will provide a start up code feel free to use that but it would be best if you use your own five-by-five that you did for the past HW.

##Now let’s do our changes

* On the main page have only the top 5 categories headings that link to another html page containing the list of 5 items on that category
* Have a different background color/image for each html page (at least one of the categories needs to have an image as a background
* Change the font family at least at one of the html pages
* Give the `<li>` elements some styling of your choice color/font/size/
* Using the attribute on `:hover` for the `<a>` change the color and the size of the font.
